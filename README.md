Trying out different financial models

1) capm_sma_strategy.py: Capital Asset Pricing Model combined with a Simple Moving Average for each individual stock
2) conintegration_pairtrading.py: A rendition of pair trading where I take the cointegration of two stocks
3) Positive_Correlation_Pairstrading.py: Another rendition of pairs trading, but instead I explore whether the two stocks are positively correlated as well as cointegrated
4) Negative_correlation_pair_trading.py: A twist on the correlations pair trading where I took two negatively correlated stocks and attempted to exploit instances where both moved in the same direction in order to long one and short the other
